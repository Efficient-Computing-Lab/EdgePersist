# Edge Registry

## Description
Edge registry aims at providing a localized Docker registry using Edge Storage as its file storage backend.
It is using Kubernetes containerization in order to provide its services, creating a new pod in the Edge Storage namespace that is able to connect to the Minio storage backend.
In addition, Edge registry creates a set of secrets that allows the secure communication between the registry and its clients using the HTTPS protocol and a basic authentication scheme.

## Setup
In order to setup Edge registry an active Edge Storage deployment must be present in the targeted minicloud.
Then the files of Edge registry must be downloaded from the gitlab page.
A bucked named "registry-edge" must be present in the Edge Storage environment.
After that the file registry_setup.sh must be executed.
After the successfull execution of registry_setup.sh the commands `update-ca-certificates` and `systemctl restart containerd` should be executed on each client in order to ensure that the SSL certificates are updated.

## Usage
The script registry_setup.sh should output simple testing instructions as well as the registry URL and credentials if it is password protected. 
In order to use the registry through Kubernetes deployment files the endpoint must be used in the image URL of the specified containers and the image must be present in Edge registry.
In order to list the available images the [docker registry API v2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) can be used, more specifically the url `/v2/_catalog`.
